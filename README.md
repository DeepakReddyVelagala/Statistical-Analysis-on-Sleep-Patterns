# Statistical-Analysis-on-Sleep-Patterns

This is an end to end statistics project on Factors affecting Sleep pattern of students at IIT Hyderabad, done as a group project for the course Applied Statistics, MA 4240 instructed by Dr. Sameen Naqvi at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad

## Objective

To identify various factors which affect our sleep and the way they affect us.

## Variables of interest

### Response variables (Response Variable is the focus of question in a study)

* Number of hours of sleep (night)
* Start time of sleep (night)
  
### Explanatory variables (Variables that affect response variables)

* Whether a person consume caffeine, yes/no
* How many times caffeinated drinks are consumed per day
* How and at when do people watch lectures
* How and when do people submit assignments?
* Screen time to study
* Start time of study
* Screen time other than study
* Time spent on physical activities
  
As our interest is to analyse natural sleeping patterns we perform an observational study.

We used *sampling* more specifically **volunteer sampling** for collection of data by sending mail to every student at IITH but only a few of them volunteered to respond. To make as many people respond as possible we also send remainders. We managed to collect data from 132 people, the data is diverse with data from all years of UG, PG and PhD students.
